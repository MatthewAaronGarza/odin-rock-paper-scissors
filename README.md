# odin-rock-paper-scissors

we're going to make rock paper scissors in the browser!

We're going to be taking the logic we have made in playing rock paper scissors and add a user interface so that 
the game can be played outside of the console

🪨, 📝, ✂️ 


FUTURE GOALS:

- add more style that shows what has been selected by the user
and by the computer so it is not just in text
    - blue border for the user
    - red border for the computer
    - purple border in the event of a tie
