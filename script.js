we're going to have the user enter an input of rock, paper, or scissors
    need to think of cases where they do not enter any of those

the computer will select rock paper or scissors randomly using a function called getComputerChoice

the function playGame(playerSelection, getComputerChoice) will see who between the player and the computer is the winner and print the
